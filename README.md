# UptimeToLogfile
Small Powershell-Script to check if a network device is reachable, writing the results into a logfile

Right now this script is designed to be edited and executed as needed. It will run indefinitely until stopped.
I didn't want to fuss around with opening the powershell and run the script with parameters but rather to configure it and let it go.
The defaults under #Settings should be sane enough, the ComputerName or IP-Address has to be put in there of course.
